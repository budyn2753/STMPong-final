#Description:

Ping-Pong
You probably heard about this game, two paddles and the ball - it's enough to have a good time  :) if you didn't hear, use google or wikipedia.

In this version you must control your paddle by using micro-controller stm32f4.

#Tools:

CooCox CoIDE

Unity Engine 5.0.1f1

#How to run:
If you want to play using a microcontroller you need STM32F4 - one for each player. You need to install VCP drivers from http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257938#.

#How to compile:
Build the STM32 Project with CooCox IDE and upload it to the STM32F407 

Build the Unity project using the Unity 5 Editor
